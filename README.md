# Advanced Quantitative Engineering & AI Portfolio

Welcome to my multi sector portfolio of projects showcasing quantitative modelling, machine learning, data engineering and AI systems design. The work spans finance, insurance, health, telecoms, public sector, retail, energy and technology. Each project includes end to end engineering steps: data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, SQL modelling, statistical and ML workflows, dashboards and technical documentation.

## Portfolio Structure

This portfolio is organised by industry sector. Each folder will contain a full project with:
- Problem description  
- Dataset and data dictionary  
- Data pipeline (Python + SQL)  
- Modelling notebooks and scripts  
- Machine learning or quantitative analysis  
- Dashboards (Power BI or similar)  
- API or app components where relevant  
- Documentation and architecture diagrams  

Planned sectors include:

- **Finance** – trading analytics, time series forecasting, risk models  
- **Insurance** – claims modelling, fraud detection, reserving  
- **Health** – hospital operations, patient flow, predictive care  
- **Telecoms** – churn prediction, usage modelling  
- **Public Sector** – city operations, service request analytics  
- **Retail** – segmentation, recommendation engines  
- **Energy** – load forecasting and optimisation
